        <h2 class="header3">Writing Scripts/Short Stories</h2>
            <p class="paragraph writingparagraph">I have written quite a few scripts since my time being here. I also have worked with friends and their projects helping them weave a narrative into their worlds. I always like to challenge myself with my writing, trying genres I may be uncomfortable with, practicing basics of storytelling to help me along the way.</p>
        <h2 class="header3">Reading Novels and Manga</h2>
        <p class="paragraph readingparagraph">I have been trying to diversify my literature by trying manga almost 6 years ago and I was blown away with the medium. It really helped to show me how important it is to lean into the strengths of the medium you are working with. I also have been reading books for a long time and I love trying new authors and finding really old and cared for books and giving them a new home in my collection.</p>
